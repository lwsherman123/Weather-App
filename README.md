# Simple Weather-App

In this project I created a simple weather app calling upon an API from https://openweathermap.org/. This is made using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript to showcase my ability in using APIs within a project.

Opening Page: 
Shows a styled search bar where you are able to type a location and gather information on the city.
